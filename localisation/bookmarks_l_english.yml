 INFORMATION_AGE_NAME:0 "The Information Age"
 INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "With the threat of the Islamic State almost gone, the war in Ukraine still happening, and North Korea rearming quickly, the world fears another great war. Economic sanctions will not stop the dictatorship, Russia and China have protected Kim Jong-un and they have challenged the Americans. Will our world collapse into war again?"
 ENG_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "Britain is in a gamble. The Brexit Referendum was successful, but the Scottish and the northern Irish may threaten to declare independence if the government leaves the Union. The number of terrorist attacks increases and the political state is confusing. The Politics of the UK are confusing for now, but it is impossible to predict if the United Kingdom will survive, It is time for the Royals and the parliament to take action."
 FRA_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "France is in a state of decay, terrorist attacks are happening every month, the far-right is rising and the people are tired of the immigrant crisis. The Economy of France is not in a good shape and neither is the EU's. The situation for the future only seems to get worse, and the people want things to change. Will France continue it's socialist policies or will the far-right rise and take over?"
 GER_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "Germany is hit by the refugee crisis and the immigrant crisis. Merkel is only one of the last standing non-far-right politicians that are keeping Germany and the European Union united. Their technological and industrial economy is still working, but the politics are their main problem to face now. Perhaps it's time to abandon the disappointment from the two world wars and enforce some border control? Or will the Germans continue with their open border policies?"
 JAP_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "Japan is faced with the possibility of war each passing day, as Chinese naval vessels aggressively close into the Senkaku Islands and recently a North Korean missile was launched into the stratosphere that almost hit the island. Article 9 of the Japanese constitution has been amended to allow for a more active Japanese military abroad. This militaristic stance is unpopular with the people, but perhaps necessary to maintain the national security."
 ITA_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "Italy has been in an economic collapse since 2008. They have tried to invest and recover, but with organized crime and other corruption scandals it was almost impossible. The refugee crisis in Europe was a last spark in the powder keg of the italian politics, Many terrorists have been killing italians and disrespecting the european culture, the far-right rises now in coalitions and the rise of fascism or populism seems to be an unstoppable event more than a future possibility. Will Fascism or Monarchism be brought back?"
 PRC_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "China is in a bad state in geopolitics. They protect the North Koreans and have alliances with Russia, but Kim Jong Un has been causing problems that could spark a nuclear war and many embargos were not enough. But abandoning the North Koreans is not a good choice either, having American-influenced South Korea on their borders is a nightmare. The future is unsure for the Chinese. They could either rise and control the world economy, or end up in  a nuclear war against the Americans, causing the end of humanity."
 RAJ_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "India's economy is rapidly growing, and so is its population. Still not greatly in the international spotlight, the Tiger is well-fed and growling. India is on the hunt, and its prey ever-so unsuspecting."
 SPR_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "Like other Southern European countries, Spain has fallen into economic crisis in 2008, requiring economic stimuli from Northern European economies. Podemos and Ciudadanos have brought a new populism and new uncertainty to the old political system, while Catalonian independence movements are more threatening to Spanish unity than ever.\n\nEconomic Recovery will be a long and rocky path - will Spain stay with Europe and stick to the agreements that prevent immediate disaster - or is the future of Spain a different one from the future of Northern Europe?"
 SOV_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "Russia is in an economic crisis since the federation was the target of sanctions from the EU. The Crimean War was costly but mostly worth it. Now they have a good grasp on Ukraine and on Crimea. China is now a great economic partner, and maybe with their help, they can recover. The North Korean problem still threatens the stability of the greater United Russia that Putin proposes, as if Kim Jong Un falls, they will have another American-influenced country within their borders, but now on the east. Will Russia rise greater and united? Will communism rise again? Or will liberalism change the mind of the Russian population?"
 USA_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC:0 "The United States of America is the growing superpower of the world, but it faces now two threats, the North Korean nuclear power and the Chinese protecting those, will Donald Trump truly make America great again, or will he lose to the communist Asians?
