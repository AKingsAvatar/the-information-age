 decision_event.1.t:0 "Taiwan Policy"
 decision_event.1.d:0 "The Peoples' Republic of China has since its inception viewed the self-proclaimed Republic of China, situated on Taiwan, with mistrust at best and open hostility at worst. Both countries continue to claim to be one true legitimate representative of China and heir to the Chinese national heritage and history. Both countries are still in frosty diplomatic relations at and times in diplomatic talks with each other, having agreed upon the 'One China principle':\n\nBoth governments agree that there is only and exactly one nation of China with a unified national identity and people and both governments agree that this exactly one nation of China has exactly one government that is legitimate.\n\nThe thing that their 'consensus' has no actual consensus on is which of the governments is the legitimate one. Both countries, in Taiwan's case sometimes depending on the ruling party, refuses to uphold diplomatic relations with a nation that upholds diplomatic relation with the other China. Due to especially the PRC's incredible international outreach and importance as a market, this is a discussion that every country MUST have a position on. We need to make a choice.\n\n(This decision will last for the next five years, after which you can choose to renew your current choice or switch to the other government.)"

After an aggressive war of Palestine and its allies against Israel, which Israel ended up winning, a spree of more than half a dozen military conflicts as well as several muslim revolts on Israeli territories were unleashed.\n\nIsrael too cannot claim complete innocence, actively encouraging its citizens to settle on territory that is internationally recognized as Palestinian in order to manipulate the demographics as well as starting preventive wars against its neighbors (for example in 1967).\n\nBut there is one fact that makes this issue even more complicated: Palestine is not a UN member state. Recognizing it as a country is not a no-brainer, as it would pose an immediate an lasting insult to Israel and Israel's supporters. Israel on the other hand is not recognized by dozens of - primarily muslim - UN member states as well. Refusing to support Palestine would surely offend some people in the greater Middle East.\n\nOur nation has to take a stand."

 european_union.10.t:0 "Abandoning the EU"
 european_union.10.d1:0 "The European Union is just a weak alliance of cuckolds, race traitors and filthy liberals. The officials in Brussels have now asked our delegation to leave their so-called 'holy halls' after one of our delegates requested a picture of Adolf Hitler to be hung up behind the speaker's podium. This probably is the beginning of the end of our EU membership - which is likely for the best, as that saves us the paperwork to quit by ourselves.\n\nThey can watch their wives get raped by foreigners all they want, but they will have to do it without us. These bastards."
 european_union.10.d2:0 "The European Union holds us and our fellow sovereign European states back from greatness. The members of our government grow increasingly upset with the European attitude towards our national sovereignity and the ease with which European delegates do whatever the United States tells them to do.\n\nWe need to quit. This is unacceptable. They can kiss American asses all they want, but they will have to do that without us."
 european_union.10.d3:0 "While monarchies are not technically banned from joining the European Union, they have to have petty little things like parliaments or elections - which the grand system around [This.GetLeader] thankfully is devoid of. This however has lead to a precarious spot for us, being asked to either hold general elections within the next week or be expelled from the halls.\n\nWell, we won't hold elections, that much is certain, so it seems they will have to play their little 'democracy' game without us."
 european_union.10.d4:0 "With a right-wing political party now in power, the democratic character and economic benefit of the European Union has been increasingly called into question.\n\nThe [This.GetRulingParty] delegates are split on the issue: The ideological hardliners want to leave the union no matter the consequences, while the economically liberal faction points to the number of jobs created by the EU and the political stability it brings to the continent.\n\nAny decision will be controversial, as the populous is split on the issue. Will the EU carry on without us - or should we stay?"
 european_union.10.d5:0 "The European Union is nothing but a bunch of capitalists that try to conquer the world for capitalism. Our brave [This.GetAdjective] delegates have stood up for the working people in every session they attended, but they are outvoted on almost any issue - when asking to disown the super rich across Europe, the delegation was even kicked from the hall! Well, maybe they should not have attacked three other delegations while their speaker was trying to argue with them, but still!\n\nThis is completely unacceptable. We can no longer carry this farce of a conglomerate. Without us!"
 european_union.10.d6:0 "Even [This.GetLeader] has remarked that the European Union is really 'nothing but a bunch of infidels' when talking to a conservative islamic newspaper last week. Because of this, calls to leave the EU have gotten louder the country over - and inside the European Union. 'If you don't respect our holy halls, leave!', the president of the European Parliament shouted at our delegation today. After one of our delegates remarked that there is nothing holy except for Allah, he was kicked from the hall.\n\nThe EU has run its course for our nation. We are thankful for their cooperation, but their hedonism and worldly intrigue is unacceptable. They will have to play their stupid games without us."

 india.1.d:0 "India Airlines Flight 814 (commonly known as IC 814) had been en route from Kathmandu, Nepal to Delhi, India on December 24th, 1999, when it was hijacked.\n\nThe hijackers took control of the airplane shortly after it left Nepali airspace and entered Indian sovereign territory. The plane went on an odyssey that was highly traumatizing and exhausting to the 176 passengers and 15 crew members held hostage.\n\nAfter touching down in Amritsar, Lahore and Dubai, the plane was finally brought to Kandahar, a Taliban-controlled city in Afghanistan. While the hijackers had left 27 hostages go in Dubai due to various and not always clear reasons, they also stabbed one of them, Rupan Katyal, to death. The aim of the islamist terrorists that apparantly belonged to the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen network was to free high-ranking islamists imprisoned in India.\n\nThe Indian government successfully negotiated for the freedom of the hostages. All of them - except for the man that had been murdered - were brought back to India in relatively good physical health."

However, the damage done to Fukushima Daiichi, one of Japan's most vital nuclear reactors, is not only out of the ordinary, but absolutely catastrophic.\nIn a nuclear disaster that only Chernobyl 1986 could measure up to, the tsunami destroyed the emergency reactors that were to cool the reactors after the automatic shutdown. The Units 1, 2 and 3 suffered nuclear meltdowns, being accompanied by hydrogen-air chemical explosions and massive release of radioactive material.\n\nThe radiation emitted by the reactor was strong enough to sentence an unprotected human to death after a mere minute; the regional area thus became uninhabitable.\n\nThe catastrophe changed public opinion on nuclear power the world over."
